# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project -
After the successful fundraising goal for Client Louise's play *Fever*, further analysis for theater plays was requested based on their launch dates and goal raising expectations.  



## Analysis and Challenges - 
Before we begin with our new analytical request, lets review our previous findings.  We previously found that there were 525 successful theater productions in the US with Great Britain registered nearly 604.  After reviewing all the data from kickstarter its safe to say that the theater category was one of the most successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As you can see in the graph below, May was by far the most sucessful month to lauch a theater campaign, and continued to have the highest number of outcomes throught nearly the end of summer September, where we will see a small uptick in October but a large continued drop for the rest of the year. With the uptick in October, there was also an increase in failed campaigns and would advise a word of caution to begin during this time period.  For the rest of the months the number of failed campaigns does not have any drastic spikes, with the biggest increast correlating with the significant increase in successful campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Calculating the successful and failed outcomes based on simply on goal expectations data demonstrate a less clear picture as to the correct avenue in which to proceed.  Outcomes with higher goal setting have a high success rate but there is also a signifant gap between the mean data observed in the graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We would recommend to use caution with this data as the outliers may be affecting the true representation of success.  Recommendation would be to perfor more extensive data analysis that would account for removing possible obscurring factors corrupting the data.  There are many 

## Results
The overall outlook for a successful campaign in either the United States or Great Britain would be significantly increased if the campaign started in late spring or early summer, with May and June being the two most desirable time periods.  A quick look at the graphs below can help demonstrate this analysis.
