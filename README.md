# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project -
    After the successful fundraising goal for Client Louise's play *Fever*, further analysis for theater plays was requested based on their launch dates and goal raising expectations.  .  

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges - 
    Before we begin with our new analytical request, lets review our previous findings.  We previously found that there were 525 successful theater productions in the US with Great Britain registered nearly 604.  After reviewing all the data from kickstarter its safe to say that the theater category was one of the most successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    As you can see in the graph below, May was by far the most sucessful month to lauch a theater campaign, and continued to have the highest number of outcomes throught nearly the end of summer September, where we will see a small uptick in October but a large continued drop for the rest of the year. With the uptick in October, there was also an increase in failed campaigns and would advise a word of caution to begin during this time period.  For the rest of the months the number of failed campaigns does not have any drastic spikes, with the biggest increast correlating with the significant increase in successful campaigns.
