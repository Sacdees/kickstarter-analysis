### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges - 
    Before we begin with our new analytical request, lets review our previous findings.  We previously found that there were 525 successful theater productions in the US with Great Britain registered nearly 604.  After reviewing all the data from kickstarter its safe to say that the theater category was one of the most successful.
